# PROJECT 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This project explores the C preprocessor, which is a tool that processes source code before it is compiled. It includes tasks that demonstrate the use of macros and predefined macros.

### File Descriptions:

- **`0-object_like_macro.h`**: A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

- **`1-pi.h`**: A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

- **`2-main.c`**: A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

- **`3-function_like_macro.h`**: A header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

- **`4-sum.h`**: A header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
