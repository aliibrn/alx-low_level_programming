# PROJECT 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists

This project introduces singly linked lists in C programming. Singly linked lists are data structures where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

---

### File Descriptions:

- **`0-print_list.c`**: A function that prints all the elements of a linked list.

- **`1-list_len.c`**: A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.

- **`2-add_node.c`**: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.

- **`3-add_node_end.c`**: A function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.

- **`4-free_list.c`**: A function that frees a linked list.

- **`101-hello_holberton.asm`**: An assembly program that prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line.

- **`lists.h`**: The header file containing all function prototypes and the definition of the `list_t` struct.
