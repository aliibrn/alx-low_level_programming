# PROJECT 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project delves deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It includes functions that perform advanced manipulations of these data structures.

---

### File Descriptions:

- **`0-strcat.c`**: A function that concatenates two strings.

- **`1-strncat.c`**: A function that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from the source string.

- **`2-strncpy.c`**: A function that copies a string.

- **`3-strcmp.c`**: A function that compares two strings.

- **`4-rev_array.c`**: A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

- **`5-string_toupper.c`**: A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- **`6-cap_string.c`**: A function that capitalizes all words of a string.

- **`7-leet.c`**: A function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) speak.

- **`100-rot13.c`**: A function that encodes a string using rot13.

- **`101-print_number.c`**: A function that prints an integer using only `_putchar()`.

- **`102-magic.c`**: A program that demonstrates the use of pointers to modify a variable's value.

- **`103-infinite_add.c`**: A function that adds two numbers stored as strings.

- **`104-print_buffer.c`**: A function that prints a buffer.

- **`_putchar.c`**: Contains the `_putchar()` function definition.
