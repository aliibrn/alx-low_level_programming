# Debugging in C Programming

Welcome to the **Debugging** folder! This directory is dedicated to helping you understand and practice the art of debugging in C programming. Debugging is a critical skill for any programmer, as it involves identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors (commonly referred to as "bugs") in your code. This folder contains several tasks and examples to guide you through the debugging process.

---

## Purpose of the Folder

The goal of this folder is to teach you how to:
- Identify errors in your code.
- Analyze the root cause of those errors.
- Apply fixes to ensure your program behaves as expected.
- Understand the importance of testing and edge cases.

By working through the examples and tasks in this folder, you'll gain hands-on experience with debugging techniques and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Contents of the Folder

### 1. **File: `0-main.c`**
This file is a test for the `positive_or_negative()` function. Your task is to:
- Create a file named `0-main.c` that tests the function with a specific case (e.g., input `0`).
- Ensure the function produces the correct output for the given input.

**Key takeaway:** Learn how to write test cases for your functions and verify their correctness.

---

### 2. **File: `1-main.c`**
This file contains a program that causes an infinite loop. Your task is to:
- Identify the part of the code causing the infinite loop.
- Comment out the problematic section without deleting it.

**Key takeaway:** Understand how to debug infinite loops and prevent them in your code.

---

### 3. **File: `2-largest_number.c`**
This program is designed to find the largest of three integers. However, the current implementation has a logical error. Your task is to:
- Fix the code so it correctly identifies the largest number in all cases.

**Key takeaway:** Practice debugging logical errors and ensure your program handles all edge cases.

---

### 4. **File: `3-print_remaining_days.c`**
This program calculates the day of the year and the number of days remaining, considering leap years. However, the current implementation has issues with leap year calculations. Your task is to:
- Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function to handle all dates and leap years correctly.

**Key takeaway:** Learn how to handle edge cases involving leap years and improve your understanding of date-related logic.

---

### Bonus: **Debugging Tips**
When you get stuck, try the following:
- Read your code aloud as if explaining it to a friend.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts and analyze each section.
- Use print statements or a debugger to trace the flow of your program.

Remember, debugging is a skill that improves with practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakesâ€”they're an essential part of learning!
