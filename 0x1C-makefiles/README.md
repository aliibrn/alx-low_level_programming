### File Descriptions:

- **`0-Makefile`**: A simple Makefile that compiles a C program with default rules.

- **`1-Makefile`**, **`2-Makefile`**, **`3-Makefile`**, **`4-Makefile`**, **`100-Makefile`**: More advanced Makefiles with additional rules and features.

- **`5-island_perimeter.py`**: A Python function that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid.

- **`main.c`**, **`school.c`**: Sample C files used for testing the Makefiles.

- **`m.h`**: A header file containing function prototypes for the sample C files.
