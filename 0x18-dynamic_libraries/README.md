# PROJECT 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

This project explores dynamic libraries in C programming. Dynamic libraries are collections of object files that are loaded into memory at runtime, providing flexibility and efficiency.

---

### File Descriptions:

- **`0-isupper.c`**: A function that checks for uppercase characters.

- **`1-create_dynamic_lib.sh`**: A script that creates a dynamic library from all `.c` files in the current directory.

- **`100-operations.so`**: A shared library containing basic arithmetic operations.

- **`101-make_me_win.sh`**: A script that manipulates the environment to win a specific task.

- **`liball.so`**: A dynamic library containing all the object files in this directory.

- **`libdynamic.so`**: Another example of a dynamic library.

- **`main.h`**: The header file containing all function prototypes.
