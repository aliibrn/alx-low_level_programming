# PROJECT 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project explores bit manipulation in C programming. Bit manipulation involves performing operations directly on bits, which is useful for optimizing performance and working with low-level data.

---

### File Descriptions:

- **`0-binary_to_uint.c`**: A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

- **`1-print_binary.c`**: A function that prints the binary representation of a number.

- **`2-get_bit.c`**: A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

- **`3-set_bit.c`**: A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

- **`4-clear_bit.c`**: A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

- **`5-flip_bits.c`**: A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

- **`100-get_endianness.c`**: A function that checks the endianness of the system.

- **`101-password`**: A file containing a password for a specific task.

- **`_putchar.c`**: Contains the `_putchar()` function definition.

- **`main.h`**: The header file containing all function prototypes.
