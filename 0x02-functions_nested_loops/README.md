# 0x02. C - Functions, Nested Loops

![Nested Loops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105258746/189934273-f596e713-d5a1-4ab2-b623-75094e5c9b0e.png)

Welcome to the **Functions and Nested Loops** project! This project dives into the fundamentals of C programming, focusing on the use of functions and nested loops to solve problems efficiently. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of how to structure your code using reusable functions and how to work with loops within loops.

## **Project Overview**

### What are Nested Loops?
A **nested loop** is a loop inside the body of another loop. This concept allows us to perform repetitive tasks in a structured and efficient way. For example, printing patterns or iterating over multi-dimensional arrays often requires nested loops.

### Why Functions?
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## **Files and Their Purpose**

### Mandatory Tasks
- **`main.h`**: The header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project. Start by creating this file‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of your project.
- **`0-putchar.c`**: A program that prints `-putchar`, followed by a new line.
- **`1-alphabet.c`**: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **`2-print_alphabet_x10.c`**: A function that prints the alphabet 10 times in lowercase, each followed by a new line.
- **`3-islower.c`**: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
- **`4-isalpha.c`**: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
- **`5-sign.c`**: A function that prints the sign of a number.
- **`6-abs.c`**: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- **`7-print_last_digit.c`**: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- **`8-24_hours.c`**: A function that prints every minute of the day, from `00:00` to `23:59`.
- **`10-add.c`**: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- **`11-print_to_98.c`**: A function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.

### Advanced Tasks
- **`100-times_table.c`**: A function that prints the `n` times table, starting with `0`.
- **`101-natural.c`**: A program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024`.
- **`102-fibonacci.c`**: A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`.
- **`103-fibonacci.c`**: A program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence below `4,000,000`.
- **`104-fibonacci.c`**: A program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Create `main.h`**: This file will contain all the function prototypes. It‚Äôs essential for the project to compile correctly.
2. **Understand the Tasks**: Each file corresponds to a specific task. Read the descriptions carefully and implement the required functionality.
3. **Test Your Code**: Use test cases to ensure your functions work as expected.
