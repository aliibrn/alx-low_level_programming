### File Descriptions:

- **`0-whatsmyname.c`**: A simple yet intriguing program that prints its own name. A great starting point to understand the basics!

- **`1-args.c`**: This program takes it up a notch by printing the number of arguments passed to it. It's all about understanding the input your program receives.

- **`2-args.c`**: Here, you will learn to print all arguments received by the program. It's about seeing the bigger picture and understanding all aspects of your program's input.

- **`3-mul.c`**: A practical and useful program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments. This will help you understand how to perform operations on input data.

- **`4-add.c`**: Building on the previous program, this one adds positive numbers passed as arguments. It's all about performing calculations and returning results.

- **`100-change.c`**: A program with real-world application! It prints the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of money. This project will challenge your problem-solving skills and enhance your logical thinking.

- **`_putchar.c`**: This file contains the definition of the `_putchar()` function, used by some of the programs to print characters.

- **`main.h`**: The header file that contains all the function prototypes for the programs in this project. A crucial part of understanding how different parts of a program communicate with each other.
