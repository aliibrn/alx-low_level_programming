## 📂 Project Files

### 🟢 `0-positive_or_negative.c`
- **Description:** Generates a random number and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Key Concepts:** `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.

---

### 🟢 `1-last_digit.c`
- **Description:** Prints the last digit of a random number and evaluates its value:
    - Greater than 5.
    - Equal to 0.
    - Less than 6 and not 0.
- **Key Concepts:** Conditional statements.

---

### 🟢 `2-print_alphabet.c`
- **Description:** Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** `for` loop for iteration.

---

### 🟢 `3-print_alphabets.c`
- **Description:** Prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** Two `for` loops for lowercase and uppercase letters.

---

### 🟢 `4-print_alphabt.c`
- **Description:** Prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding `q` and `e`, followed by a new line.

---

### 🟢 `5-print_numbers.c`
- **Description:** Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** `for` loop for iteration.

---

### 🟢 `6-print_numberz.c`
- **Description:** Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** Uses `putchar` instead of `printf`.

---

### 🟢 `7-print_tebahpla.c`
- **Description:** Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** Reverse iteration using a `for` loop.

---

### 🟢 `8-print_base16.c`
- **Description:** Prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- **Key Concepts:** Combines `for` loops and `putchar`.

---

### 🟢 `9-print_comb.c`
- **Description:** Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by `, `.
- **Key Concepts:** Ascending order with proper formatting.

---

### 🟢 `10-print_comb2.c`
- **Description:** Prints numbers from `00` to `99`, separated by `, `.
- **Key Concepts:** Nested `for` loops for iteration.

---

### 🟢 `100-print_comb3.c`
- **Description:** Prints all unique combinations of two digits in ascending order, separated by `, `.
- **Key Concepts:** Avoids duplicate combinations.

---

### 🟢 `101-print_comb4.c`
- **Description:** Prints all unique combinations of three digits in ascending order, separated by `, `.
- **Key Concepts:** Ensures unique and ordered combinations.

---

### 🟢 `102-print_comb5.c`
- **Description:** Prints all combinations of two two-digit numbers in ascending order, separated by a space.
- **Key Concepts:** Nested loops for pairing numbers.
