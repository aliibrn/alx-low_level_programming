# PROJECT 0x09. C - Static Libraries

This project focuses on the creation and usage of static libraries in C programming. Static libraries are collections of object files that are linked into programs at compile time, providing reusable code.

---

### File Descriptions:

- **`create_static_lib.sh`**: A script that creates a static library from all `.c` files in the current directory.

- **`liball.a`**: A static library containing all the object files in this directory.

- **`libmy.a`**: Another example of a static library.

- **`main.c`**: A sample main program to test the static library.

- **`main.h`**: The header file containing all function prototypes.

- **Various `.c` files**: These files contain the implementation of functions that are compiled into object files and included in the static libraries.
