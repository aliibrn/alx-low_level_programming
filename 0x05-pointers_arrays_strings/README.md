### File Descriptions:

- **`0-reset_to_98.c`**: A function that updates the value of a variable to 98 using a pointer.

- **`1-swap.c`**: A function that swaps the values of two integers.

- **`2-strlen.c`**: A function that returns the length of a string.

- **`3-puts.c`**: A function that prints a string followed by a new line.

- **`4-print_rev.c`**: A function that prints a string in reverse.

- **`5-rev_string.c`**: A function that reverses a string.

- **`6-puts2.c`**: A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

- **`7-puts_half.c`**: A function that prints the second half of a string.

- **`8-print_array.c`**: A function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers.

- **`9-strcpy.c`**: A function that copies a string to a buffer.

- **`100-atoi.c`**: A function that converts a string to an integer.

- **`101-keygen.c`**: A program that generates random valid passwords for a given program.

- **`_putchar.c`**: Contains the `_putchar()` function definition.
