 * Description: This program utilizes the printf() function to display
 * formatted output to stdout. Unlike puts(), printf() provides more control
 * over output formatting and requires explicit newline characters (\n).
 * The program outputs the continuation of a philosophical statement about
 * programming: "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,"
 * emphasizing the artistic nature of well-written code.
 *
 * Return: 0 on successful execution, non-zero on failure
